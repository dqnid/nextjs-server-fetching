# NEXTjs Server side Rendering

This is intended to be a small and humble presentation about the server side
rendering implementation in NEXTjs and its multiple benefits. This projects
objective is twofold:

1. I want to learn new ways of using this feature in my projects besides
   learning how the stuff I know to works under the blanket.
2. To promote its use within my office to enjoy its benefits.
